# SyntComplex
Repository for scripts to calculate syntactic complexity using various measures.

## SSJ-UD vs SST-UD
The repository currently contains the script used to calculate the results described in the paper "Uporaba Å¡estih mer skladenjske kompleksnosti za primerjavo jezika v govornem in pisnem korpusu" ([link](https://www.sdjt.si/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JT-DH_2024_Tercon.pdf) - unfortunately only in Slovenian, but I hear MT systems can do wonders these days).

The _scripts_ directory contains the scripts used in that study, while _results_ contains the calculations of various complexity measures for the SSJ-UD and SST-UD treebanks.
